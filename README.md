# CryptoFragments

CryptoFragments is a Python-based tool that securely fragments, encrypts, and manages seed phrases using Shamir's Secret Sharing scheme. This project allows you to split a sensitive seed phrase into multiple shares, encrypt and store them safely, and recover the original seed phrase with a threshold number of shares.

---

## Features

- **Seed Phrase Fragmentation**: Securely split a seed phrase into multiple shares using Shamir's Secret Sharing.
- **Threshold Recovery**: Recover the original seed phrase with a minimum threshold of shares.
- **Encryption**: Encrypt each share using AES encryption for enhanced security.
- **Automatic File Management**: Automatically detect and manage share and key files.
- **Dynamic Threshold Detection**: Extract the required threshold dynamically from the share metadata.
- **QR Code Support**: Export and decode shares and keys as QR codes for easier distribution and recovery.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive handling of file, decryption, and recovery errors.

## How It Works

1. **Fragmentation**:
   - The seed phrase is split into `n` shares, and only a `threshold` number of shares are required to recover it.

2. **Encryption**:
   - Each share is encrypted with a unique key to ensure secure storage.

3. **File Management**:
    - Encrypted shares and their keys are saved as files (`share_*.enc` and `key_*.key`) or exported as QR codes.


4. **Recovery**:
   - The original seed phrase is recovered using a minimum threshold of decrypted shares.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Virtual environment (optional, but recommended)

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chr1570ph3/CryptoFragments.git
   cd CryptoFragments
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
### Fragment and Encrypt a Seed Phrase
Run the `basic_usage.py` script to fragment and encrypt a seed phrase:
```bash
python examples/basic_usage.py --seed "your seed phrase" --output-dir output --export-qrcode
```
```bash
python main.py --seed-file seed.txt --export-qrcode
```


This will:
- Split your seed phrase into shares.
- Encrypt each share and save it as `share_*.enc`.
- Save the corresponding encryption keys as `key_*.key`.
- Optionally export the shares and keys as QR codes (share_*.png and key_*.png).


## Recover a Seed Phrase
Run the `recovery_test.py` script to recover a seed phrase:
```bash
python examples/recovery_test.py --directory output --threshold 3
```

This will:

- Automatically detect the available `share_*.enc` and `key_*.key` files.
- Decrypt and process up to the required threshold of shares.
- Recover the original seed phrase.

## Best Practices
1. Run Offline: Always run the program on an offline, secure computer to minimize exposure.
1. Store `share_*.enc`/`share_*.png` and `key_*.key`/key_*.png` files in separate, secure locations.
1. Redundant Backups: Maintain multiple backups of your shares and keys.
1. Threshold Awareness: Ensure you always have the minimum number of shares (threshold) required for recovery.
1. Test Recovery: Regularly test the recovery process with dummy data to ensure everything works as expected.

## Libraries Used
`pillow`: Handles image processing for opening and saving QR code images.
`pyzbar`: Decodes QR codes from image files.
`qrcode`: Generates QR code images for encrypted shares and keys.
